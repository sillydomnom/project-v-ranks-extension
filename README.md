# Project V Ranks Visible (s. [ProjectV](https://projectv.gg))

This plugin is for all of those, trying to find a team that kinda plays in your Leauge. It is really hard and can get to your nerves to try to find the next match, with no visible info. Therefore this Extension hopefully helps!

## Develepoment

I am not advanced in Chrome Extension making, so help is appreciated! Moreover there are some smaller bugs, where I can't get hang out why tf they are happening. 

## Contributing

The next planned features are: 

- Adding the Ranking BAdge on the profile page
- Refactor code in a more understandable-ish way
- Change Unstable Code that checks all network requests to a less intrusive functionality
